        <p class="section-two__desc">
          I’ve always been captivated by how technology can tackle everyday
          challenges. This passion led me to pursue a Web Development degree at
          Conestoga College, where I dove deep into creating scalable
          applications that prioritize user experience. My journey has been
          filled with exciting projects that allowed me to sharpen my skills in
          front-end technologies like React.js and Next.js while also exploring
          the full stack with Node.js and MongoDB. One of my favorite
          accomplishments was designing my personal portfolio website using
          Next.js and TypeScript. It wasn’t just about showcasing my work; it
          was an opportunity to apply SEO best practices and monitor performance
          through Lighthouse to improve visibility. I loved crafting a
          responsive UI/UX that feels modern yet functional—it's amazing how the
          right design can enhance user interaction. During my time as a
          Full-Stack Developer on an academic project called Cuisine Cart at
          Conestoga College, I built a tiffin service web application from the
          ground up. I developed REST APIs for smooth data flow and integrated
          secure payment systems while ensuring user-friendly interfaces for
          chefs and customers alike. Seeing it come together was incredibly
          rewarding! As a freelancer on platforms like Upwork, I had the chance
          to create visually engaging websites for clients like BrightNest
          Interiors in Chennai. Building the front-end using HTML, CSS, and
          vanilla JavaScript taught me the importance of fast load times and
          seamless responsiveness across devices—skills I carry into every
          project. When I'm not coding or designing websites, you might find me
          exploring new tech trends or volunteering in local community
          initiatives that promote digital literacy. If you’re interested in
          collaborating or just want to chat about web development trends over
          coffee (or virtually), feel free to reach out via email! Skills:
